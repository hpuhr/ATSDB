/**
 * @mainpage  ATSDB Main Page
 *
 * This library encapsulates a database system and allows reading and writing of flight surveillance data.
 *
 * The main access point is the class ATSDB. Using this singleton, surveillance data can be written using the RDL
 * tool and SQLite3 file containers or a MySQL database.
 *
 * Most of the classes were written to be persistent, meaning that local parameters can saved/restored using a sophisticated
 * Configuration framework. Also, there exists a mechanism for dynamic creation of instances based on such a Configuration,
 * which is embedded in the class Configurable. The main access point for this framework is the class ConfigurationManager.
 *
 * Based on the this configuration, an abstract representation of objects stored in the database was created, which should
 * largely be independent of the database schema. Such an object is called DBObject, all of which are managed by the DBObjectManager.
 *
 * Also based on the configuration is the database filtering system. The FilterManager is used to manage filters using the DBFilter
 * class, which itself holds filter conditions based on the DBFilterCondition class. For each DBObject, the current conditions in the
 * SQL query can be retrieved from the active filters.
 *
 * The most common data storage container is a Buffer, a dynamic and fast mechanism for data storage and retrieval. It is based on
 * memory pages based on the ArrayTemplate in interplay with the ArrayTemplateManager, and the MemoryManager which is the main
 * access point for memory allocation and management.

/**
 * @brief Main access point for all library function.
 *
 * @details Singleton, uses separate thread. Is started using the init function (with a connection type specifying the database
 * system and parameters). Has functionality which generates and allows access to sensor information of DBObjects. Allows reading/writing
 * data from/to the database and various access function. Can be stopped using the shutdown function.
 *
 * Note the following example code:
 * @code
 *  DBConnectionInfo *info = ...;
 *  ATSDB::getInstance().init (info);
 *  // do stuff
 *  ATSDB::getInstance().shutdown();
 * @endcode
 *
 * \todo Change sorting if export is active
 * \todo Maybe extend some classes to observer pattern
 * \todo Removed writing of new databases. Re-integrated if necessary
